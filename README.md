# shopper_challenge

Notes:

* Original starter code was a Rails app. I haven't used Ruby nor Rails in depth before. Gave it a try but ran into problems while trying to install Nokogiri, tried to fix it for ~1 hour.
* Decided to write app in Python/Flask from scratch and then integrate with any necessary parts from the starter app. (Since I am familiar with Python, and Flask is a lightweight framework so it's easy and fast to get it set up.)
